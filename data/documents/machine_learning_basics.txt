Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, where each input comes with the correct output. The model maps inputs to desired outputs and improves over time.
Examples: Classification (spam detection), Regression (house price prediction).

2. Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised learning works on unlabeled data. The algorithm finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
Examples: Clustering (customer segmentation), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).

3. Reinforcement Learning:
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
Example: Game playing AI, robotics control.

Important concepts:
- Features: Input variables used by the model.
- Labels: The output or target variable in supervised learning.
- Overfitting: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, reducing its performance on new data.
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple and cannot capture underlying patterns.

Common algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- ROC-AUC

Data preprocessing steps:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Normalization/Standardization
- Feature selection/engineering

ML Workflow:
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model selection
4. Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Machine learning plays a crucial role in many applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
