Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

Key concepts:
- Neural Networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons).
- Each neuron receives input, applies a weight and bias, and passes through an activation function.
- Common activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.
- Deep neural networks have multiple hidden layers enabling hierarchical feature extraction.

Types of Neural Networks:
- Feedforward Neural Networks: Data moves in one direction, from input to output.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image and spatial data.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data like time series or language.
- Transformers: Use attention mechanisms and are state-of-the-art for NLP tasks.

Training:
- Uses backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize loss functions.
- Requires large amounts of labeled data and computational power.
- Overfitting can be mitigated by dropout, regularization, and data augmentation.

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
- Healthcare diagnostics

Deep learning has revolutionized AI by enabling models to learn directly from raw data with minimal feature engineering.
