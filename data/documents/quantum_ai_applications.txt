Quantum computing and AI are complementary technologies.
AI algorithms can optimize quantum gate sequences and error correction protocols.
In turn, quantum computers could accelerate the training of certain AI models.
Researchers in quantum physics use machine learning to predict quantum state evolution,
classify phases of matter, and discover new quantum algorithms.
