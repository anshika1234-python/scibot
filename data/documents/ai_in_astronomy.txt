In astronomy, AI assists in analyzing massive datasets from telescopes and satellites.
Deep learning models can classify galaxies, detect exoplanets, and identify gravitational wave signals.
By automating data processing, AI enables astronomers to focus on scientific interpretation
rather than manual data cleaning and labeling.
