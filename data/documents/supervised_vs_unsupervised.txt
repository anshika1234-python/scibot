Supervised Learning:
- Uses labeled data where each input example is paired with the correct output.
- The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- Examples include classification and regression problems.
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks.
- Example use case: Email spam detection where emails are labeled as 'spam' or 'not spam'.

Unsupervised Learning:
- Uses unlabeled data with no explicit output labels.
- The goal is to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
- Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders.
- Example use case: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior without pre-existing categories.

Differences:
- Data Requirement: Supervised requires labeled data; unsupervised does not.
- Objective: Supervised predicts outcomes; unsupervised discovers structure.
- Feedback: Supervised learning uses feedback from labeled data; unsupervised learns patterns without feedback.

Hybrid approaches also exist, such as semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning, combining elements of both.
